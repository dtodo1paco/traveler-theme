#Using traveler theme

This theme provides special classes to create specific content, for example:

You can use "fullHeight" in a block element to provide the same height as browser size, this class is used for example on main animated content.

Inside these blocks you can use "fullCenter" class, to relocate the element in the middle of previous item

You can control bg-images easier with classes: "img-bg" (Cover images) "bg-right" / "bg-right" (to control bg aligment) and "img-bg-fixed" to fix a bg image.

You will be able to use "scroll-animate" class into links redirected to an anchor, this will create a screen transition with a movement between link and anchor.

I integrated a really good CSS animation gallery to manage animations in this theme, to use its animations when the element animated appears, you only need add into item: animation duration "infinite/1s" class="1s pre-animated" and data-effect with the effect which you want: effect="zoomIn"
